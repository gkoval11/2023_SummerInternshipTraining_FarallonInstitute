The purpose of this tutorial is to learn, through examples, the necessary `Python` code and tools required to work with satellite data. Please see the __Resources__ section in each chapter to learn more about `Python` and libraries used.\n",

    "## Python Scientific Ecosystem\n",
    "There is a number of libraries and data structures in `Python` that make it ideal for Earth Sciences. Because of Python's modular structure, new and specific libraries are built on, and take advantage of, more basic but well developed ones. For example, the __xarray__ library is not only developed on top of `Python`, but also uses the __SciPy__, __pandas__ and __matplotlib__ libraries, which are built on top of __NumPy__.\n",

    "## How to use these tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to program in `Python`. In this tutorial we use the web interface `Google Collab` (__Chapter 2__ gives a quick overview on how to use it). In __Chapter 3__ we will learn basic and necessary `Python` commands and data structures, and in __Chapters 4 and 5__ we will learn the tools (libraries) we need (and that make `Python` ideal) for environmental science data analysis. Then __Chapters 6 and 7__ include two real world examples combining all of the previous chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only cover, through examples, the necessary and basic knowledge you need to be able to navigate the applications chapters, where we use project-like examples to illustrate how to acquire, analyze and visualize satellite data. You'll learn the capabilities of `Python`, and can use these examples to build your own.\n",

    "## Where to get help\n",
    "Beyond the __Resources__ links provided, like with everything these days: when in doubt, __google it!__ You'll find many useful pages and videos. One of the best Q&A resources, and many times the first link in a google search, it is [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This site is an always evolving community in which people ask and answer coding questions. \n"
